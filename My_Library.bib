  abstract = {Changepoints are abrupt variations in the generative parameters of a data sequence. Online detection of changepoints is useful in modelling and prediction of time series in application areas such as finance, biometrics, and robotics. While frequentist methods have yielded online filtering and prediction techniques, most Bayesian papers have focused on the retrospective segmentation problem. Here we examine the case where the model parameters before and after the changepoint are independent and we derive an online algorithm for exact inference of the most recent changepoint. We compute the probability distribution of the length of the current “run,” or time since the last changepoint, using a simple message-passing algorithm. Our implementation is highly modular so that the algorithm may be applied to a variety of types of data. We illustrate this modularity by demonstrating the algorithm on three different real-world data sets.},

  abstract = {we consider the problem of sequential change-point detection where 	both the change-points and the distributions before and after the change are assumed to be unknown. For this problem of primary importance in statistical and sequential learning theory, we derive a variant of the Bayesian Online Change Point Detector proposed by \textbackslash cite\{fearnhead2007line\} 	which is easier to analyze than the original version while keeping its powerful message-passing algorithm. 	We provide a non-asymptotic analysis of the false-alarm rate and the detection delay that matches the existing lower-bound. We further provide the first explicit high-probability control of the detection delay for such approach. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data show that this proposal outperforms the state-of-art change-point detection strategy, namely the Improved Generalized Likelihood Ratio (Improved GLR) while compares favorably with the original Bayesian Online Change Point Detection strategy.},

  abstract = {Change point detection is an important part of time series analysis, as the presence of a change point indicates an abrupt and significant change in the data generating process. While many algorithms for change point detection have been proposed, comparatively little attention has been paid to evaluating their performance on real-world time series. Algorithms are typically evaluated on simulated data and a small number of commonly-used series with unreliable ground truth. Clearly this does not provide sufficient insight into the comparative performance of these algorithms. Therefore, instead of developing yet another change point detection method, we consider it vastly more important to properly evaluate existing algorithms on real-world data. To achieve this, we present a data set specifically designed for the evaluation of change point detection algorithms that consists of 37 time series from various application domains. Each series was annotated by five human annotators to provide ground truth on the presence and location of change points. We analyze the consistency of the human annotators, and describe evaluation metrics that can be used to measure algorithm performance in the presence of multiple ground truth annotations. Next, we present a benchmark study where 14 algorithms are evaluated on each of the time series in the data set. Our aim is that this data set will serve as a proving ground in the development of novel change point detection algorithms.},

Here, we introduce a highly flexible framework for modeling actions within social settings, which permits likelihood-based inference for behavioral mechanisms with complex dependence. Examples are given for the parameterization of base activity levels, recency, persistence, preferential attachment, transitive/cyclic interaction, and participation shifts within the relational event framework. Parameter estimation is discussed both for data in which an exact history of events is available, and for data in which only event sequences are known. The utility of the framework is illustrated via an application to dynamic modeling of responder radio communications during the early hours of the World Trade Center disaster.},

  abstract = {Time series segmentation, which is also known as multiple-change-point detection, is a well-established problem. However, few solutions have been designed specifically for high dimensional situations. Our interest is in segmenting the second-order structure of a high dimensional time series. In a generic step of a binary segmentation algorithm for multivariate time series, one natural solution is to combine cumulative sum statistics obtained from local periodograms and cross-periodograms of the components of the input time series. However, the standard ‘maximum’ and ‘average’ methods for doing so often fail in high dimensions when, for example, the change points are sparse across the panel or the cumulative sum statistics are spuriously large. We propose the sparsified binary segmentation algorithm which aggregates the cumulative sum statistics by adding only those that pass a certain threshold. This ‘sparsifying’ step reduces the influence of irrelevant noisy contributions, which is particularly beneficial in high dimensions. To show the consistency of sparsified binary segmentation, we introduce the multivariate locally stationary wavelet model for time series, which is a separate contribution of this work.},

  abstract = {Many traditional methods for identifying changepoints can struggle in the presence of outliers, or when the noise is heavy-tailed. Often they will infer additional changepoints to fit the outliers. To overcome this problem, data often needs to be preprocessed to remove outliers, though this is difficult for applications where the data needs to be analyzed online. We present an approach to changepoint detection that is robust to the presence of outliers. The idea is to adapt existing penalized cost approaches for detecting changes so that they use loss functions that are less sensitive to outliers. We argue that loss functions that are bounded, such as the classical biweight loss, are particularly suitable—as we show that only bounded loss functions are robust to arbitrarily extreme outliers. We present an efficient dynamic programming algorithm that can find the optimal segmentation under our penalized cost criteria. Importantly, this algorithm can be used in settings where the data needs to be analyzed online. We show that we can consistently estimate the number of changepoints, and accurately estimate their locations, using the biweight loss function. We demonstrate the usefulness of our approach for applications such as analyzing well-log data, detecting copy number variation, and detecting tampering of wireless devices. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

We assume that the number of change-points can increase to infinity with the sample size. Due to a certain random localisation mechanism, WBS works even for very short spacings between the change-points and/or very small jump magnitudes, unlike standard binary segmentation. On the other hand, despite its use of localisation, WBS does not require the choice of a window or span parameter, and does not lead to a significant increase in computational complexity. WBS is also easy to code. We propose two stopping criteria for WBS: one based on thresholding and the other based on what we term the `strengthened Schwarz information criterion'. We provide default recommended values of the parameters of the procedure and show that it offers very good practical performance in comparison with the state of the art. The WBS methodology is implemented in the R package wbs, available on CRAN. In addition, we provide a new proof of consistency of binary segmentation with improved rates of convergence, as well as a corresponding result for WBS.},

This complex and growing area of research has no clear guidelines on what methods to use or in which circumstances. This paper critically discusses several possible network metrics to be used for a change point detection problem and conducts an experimental, comparative analysis using the Enron and MIT networks. Bayesian change point detection analysis is conducted on different global graph metrics (Size, Density, Average Clustering Coefficient, Average Shortest Path) as well as metrics derived from the Hierarchical and Block models (Entropy, Edge Probability, No. of Communities, Hierarchy Level Membership). The results produced the posterior probability of a change point at weekly time intervals that were analysed against ground truth change points using precision and recall measures. Results suggest that computationally heavy generative models offer only slightly better results compared to some of the global graph metrics. The simplest metrics used in the experiments, i.e. nodes and links numbers, are the recommended choice for detecting overall structural changes.},

We consider the common approach of detecting changepoints through minimizing a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. This includes several established procedures for detecting changing points, such as penalized likelihood and minimum description length. We introduce a new method for finding the minimum of such cost functions and hence the optimal number and location of changepoints that has a computational cost, which, under mild conditions, is linear in the number of observations. This compares favorably with existing methods for the same problem whose computational cost can be quadratic or even cubic. In simulation studies, we show that our new method can be orders of magnitude faster than these alternative exact methods. We also compare with the binary segmentation algorithm for identifying changepoints, showing that the exactness of our approach can lead to substantial improvements in the accuracy of the inferred segmentation of the data.

  abstract = {Real-life social interactions occur in continuous time and are driven by complex mechanisms. Each interaction is not only affected by the characteristics of individuals or the environmental context but also by the history of interactions. The relational event framework provides a flexible approach to studying the mechanisms that drive how a sequence of social interactions evolves over time. This paper presents an introduction of this new statistical framework and two of its extensions for psychological researchers. The relational event framework is illustrated with an exemplary study on social interactions between freshmen students at the start of their new studies. We show how the framework can be used to study (a) which predictors are important drivers of social interactions between freshmen students who start interacting at zero acquaintance, (b) how the effects of predictors change over time as acquaintance increases, and (c) the dynamics between the different settings in which students interact. Findings show that patterns of interaction developed early in the freshmen student network and remained relatively stable over time. Furthermore, clusters of interacting students formed quickly, and predominantly within a specific setting for interaction. Extraversion predicted rates of social interaction, and this effect was particularly pronounced on the weekends.},

  abstract = {The relational event model (REM) facilitates the study of network evolution in relational event history data, i.e., time-ordered sequences of social interactions. In real-life social networks it is likely that network effects, i.e., the parameters that quantify the relative importance of drivers of these social interaction sequences, change over time. In these networks, the basic REM is not appropriate to understand what drives network evolution. This research extends the REM framework with approaches for testing and exploring time-varying network effects. First, we develop a Bayesian approach to test whether network effects change during the study period. We conduct a simulation study that illustrates that the Bayesian test accurately quantifies the evidence between a basic (‘static’) REM or a dynamic REM. Secondly, in the case of the latter, time-varying network effects can be studied by means of a moving window that slides over the relational event history. A simulation study was conducted that illustrates that the accuracy and precision of the estimates depend on the window width: narrower windows result in greater accuracy at the cost of lower precision. Third, we develop a Bayesian approach for determining window widths using the empirical network data and conduct a simulation study that illustrates that estimation with empirically determined window widths achieves both good accuracy for time intervals with important changes and good precision for time intervals with hardly any changes in the effects. Finally, in an empirical application, we illustrate how the approaches in this research can be used to test for and explore time-varying network effects of face-to-face contacts at the workplace.},

  abstract = {When on-site classification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is required, a portable ion mobility spectrometer (IMS) is a suitable choice. However, the IMS readings often show transient phases before they stabilize. Even so the importance of transient phase and features extracted from it has been highlighted in the literature, it has not, to our knowledge, been used for IMS-based classification so far. This paper analyzes whether change point detection algorithms with low computational complexity can separate transient and stable phases in IMS readings. The algorithms were tested on IMS data from different types of mushrooms. All algorithms successfully detected switches from transient to stable phase. The most accurate results were provided by the previously proposed multivariate max-CUSUM algorithm and the matrix form CUSUM algorithm, which is developed in this paper.},

In this paper, we focus our attention on NH-DBNs that are based on Bayesian piecewise linear regression models. The new NH-DBN model, proposed here, is a generalization of an earlier proposed model with sequentially coupled network interaction parameters. Unlike the original model, our novel model possesses segment-specific coupling parameters, so that the coupling strengths between parameters can vary over time. Thereby, to avoid model overflexibility and to allow for some information exchange among time segments, we globally couple the segment-specific coupling (strength) parameters by a hyperprior. Our empirical results on synthetic and on real biological network data show that the new model yields better network reconstruction accuracies than the original model.},

A conventional assumption for non-homogeneous regulatory processes on a short time scale is that the network structure stays constant across time, while the network parameters are time-dependent. The objective is then to learn the network structure along with changepoints that divide the time series into time segments. An uncoupled model learns the parameters separately for each segment, while a coupled model enforces the parameters of any segment to stay similar to those of the previous segment. In this paper, we propose a new consensus model that infers for each individual time segment whether it is coupled to (or uncoupled from) the previous segment.},

  abstract = {Non-homogeneous dynamic Bayesian networks (NH-DBNs) are a popular tool for learning networks with time-varying interaction parameters. A multiple changepoint process is used to divide the data into disjoint segments and the network interaction parameters are assumed to be segment-specific. The objective is to infer the network structure along with the segmentation and the segment-specific parameters from the data. The conventional (uncoupled) NH-DBNs do not allow for information exchange among segments, and the interaction parameters have to be learned separately for each segment. More advanced coupled NH-DBN models allow the interaction parameters to vary but enforce them to stay similar over time. As the enforced similarity of the network parameters can have counter-productive effects, we propose a new consensus NH-DBN model that combines features of the uncoupled and the coupled NH-DBN. The new model infers for each individual edge whether its interaction parameter stays similar over time (and should be coupled) or if it changes from segment to segment (and should stay uncoupled).Our new model yields higher network reconstruction accuracies than state-of-the-art models for synthetic and yeast network data. For gene expression data from A.thaliana our new model infers a plausible network topology and yields hypotheses about the light-dependencies of the gene interactions.Data are available from earlier publications.

We measure the power and accuracy of these current methods using simulated data. We draw comparisons on the functionality and usefulness of each method.

  abstract = {Changepoint detection is the problem of estimating the point at which the statistical properties of a sequence of observations change. Over the years several multiple changepoint search algorithms have been proposed to overcome this challenge. They include binary segmentation algorithm, the Segment neighbourhood algorithm and the Pruned Exact Linear Time (PELT) algorithm. The PELT algorithm is exact and under mild conditions has a computational cost that is linear in the number of data points. PELT is more accurate than binary segmentation and faster as than other exact search methods. However, there is scanty literature on the sensitivity/power of PELT algorithm as the changepoints approach the extremes and as the size of change increases. In this paper, we implemented the PELT algorithm which uses a common approach of detecting changepoints through minimising a cost function over possible numbers and locations of changepoints. The study used simulated data to determine the power of the PELT test. The study investigated the power of the PELT algorithm in relation to the size of the change and the location of changepoints. It was observed that the power of the test, for a given size of change, is almost the same at all changepoints location. Also, the power of the test increases with the increase in size of change.},
